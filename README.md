# SKU-Encoder

## Why do you need an SKU Generator?

I'm about to start selling products in person. And I'm an analyst by trade. I like the numbers. To keep more accurate information about mhy current inventory, I needed a good scheme for encoding/decoding unique SKUs. The values I've provided in my text file are really for me and my use but can easily be updated. 

Thanks!
